# Notes

Factors that we might wish to consider when developing a fleshed out encounter scenario:

1. Environment: Underdark, forest, swamp etc typically drives the denizens/threats of a given area. You arent gonna find a death-camel in a swamp.
2. Story Theme: Are the PCs tracking down the leader of an evil cult? Then the enemies would be clerics, fighters, and some trained "pets". Ravenloft? Lots of undead.
3. Threat level: easy, medium/hard/deadly
4. Percentage chance of combat: Sometimes, PCs can talk their way out of a fight, and this also drives what type of creatures might be in an area.
5. Type of encounter: Monster lair, random/patrol encounter, ambush, etc - typically, I make a cool map and thrn figure out who "lives" there
6. Are the PCs at a combat advantage (high ground) or at a disadvantage (in a chokepoint, or in a room that could be flooded by an enemy)
